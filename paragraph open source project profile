github profile review: https://github.com/msmhq/msm.git

I've noticed that a group of developers commit to this project. A person named "endofcake" seems to be the most recent push. The account manages pull requests by seeing the title of the request and running the code to see if it works. some pull requests are rejected. The title usually mentions the type of feature/fix that is implemented. The issues tab is used extensively, which means many people are on the project and constantly debugging it or making new features.
